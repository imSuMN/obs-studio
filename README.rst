What is Ping Studio?
-------------------

Ping Studio is a build of OBS Studio designed to run without conflicts alongside a normal OBS install, allowing the compositing of an additional feed for recording or use as a virtual camera.

Virtual cameras are more stable than hardware devices when used in multiple programs at once. Hardware devices may encounter issues or not work at all when used with multiple programs. Ping Studio's virtual camera will work perfectly for this use case.

It's distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 (or any later
version) - see the accompanying COPYING file for more details.
